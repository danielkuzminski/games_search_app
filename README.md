# General info

This project was created in React, along with json server.
Genereal purpose of this app is to create local database of games, and to display them, along with filtering genres.
Have fun using it :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run db`

Script to run json server database in localhost.
To make everything work you'll need to install json server at first.
To do so run: "npm install -g json-server".
Please note that you may be asked to run above command as an admin (with sudo command)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Please note, this app requires you to run json server at first, to work properly.
Once json server is running, will block port 3000, which will occur in running local host on different port.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

Once again, have fun with the app :)
